abstract = {In a distributed large-scale video-on-demand (VoD) streaming network, a content provider often deploys local servers close to their users. A movie is partitioned into k segments which the servers collaboratively replicate and retrieve (k â‰¥ 1). A critical but challenging problem is how to minimize overall system deployment cost consisting of server bandwidth, server storage, and network traffic among servers. In this paper, we address this problem through jointly optimizing movie storage and retrieval in the server network. We first formulate the optimization problem and show that it is NP-hard. To address the problem, we propose a novel, effective and implementable heuristic termed LP-SR. LP-SR decomposes the optimization problem into two computationally efficient linear programs (LPs) for segment storage and retrieval, respectively. The strength of LP-SR is that it is asymptotically optimal in terms of k, and k is not high to be closely optimal (around 5 to 10 in our study). For large movie pool, we propose a movie grouping algorithm to further reduce the computational complexity without compromising much on the performance. Through extensive simulation, LP-SR is shown to perform significantly the best as compared with other state-of-the-art and traditional schemes, reducing the deployment cost by a wide margin (by multiple times in many cases). It attains performance very close to the global optimum. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Video-on-Demand (VOD) systems knows a huge success for several reasons: a) each peer is both server and client leading to scalable system, b) it is not necessary to build and maintain infrastructures. BitTorrent is the most popular P2P file sharing protocols due to its effectiveness in the delivery of content. Thus, many VoD protocols have been proposed based on it. They investigate new ways for pieces and neighbor peers selections to assure the tight displaying time deadlines of video frames. In this paper, we present an up-to-date literature review of the main P2P VoD works based on the BitTorrent protocol. Furthermore, we propose a taxonomy of these works considering the pieces and the peers selection algorithms criterions.},

abstract = {Given the exploding growth of video traffic, efficient video distribution is essential to the future Internet. Therefore, how to optimize its networking cost is a critical research problem. In this paper, we introduce Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in conjunction with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to minimize the cost via joint orchestration of caching, transcoding and routing functions. Specifically, we propose a two-step iterative approach. First, in NFV-based resource allocation phase, we maximize total cache hits by optimally allocating storage and computing resources for a giving routing policy. Second, in SDN-based routing phase, we minimize the networking cost by optimally configuring the routing matrix for a given resource placement. Finally, we analytically prove their iterative repeat converges to the joint optimum. Through extensive simulations, we verify its convergence, and performance gains compared with the optimal solution of either phase alone. By examining numerical results, we obtain some operational guidelines. From the resource allocation aspect, we should allocate more resources to the node with heavier request rate. From the routing aspect, for each node-server pair, the node should split the traffic across multiple paths with identical shortest hops if there are many, or use the shortest path alone if there is only one. {\textcopyright} 2015 IFIP.},

abstract = {Recently, the Internet has witnessed the emergence of content distribution networks (CDNs). In this paper, we study the problem of optimally replicating objects in CDN servers. In our model, each Internet autonomous system (AS) is a node with finite storage capacity for replicating objects. The optimization problem is to replicate objects so that when clients fetch objects from the nearest CDN server with the requested object, the average number of ASs traversed is minimized. We formulate this problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. We show that this optimization problem is NP complete. We develop four natural heuristics and compare them numerically using real Internet topology data. We find that the best results are obtained with heuristics that have all the CDN servers cooperating in making the replication decisions. We also develop a model for studying the benefits of cooperation between nodes, which provides insight into peer-to-peer content distribution. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Optimistic unchoking plays an important role in BitTorrent peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing networks. Peers use optimistic unchoking to find upload bandwidth information about their neighbors. However, free-riders can also take advantage of optimistic unchoking and download from the network without uploading anything. In this paper, we propose a novel optimistic unchoking algorithm for BitTorrent. The main purposes of our algorithm are to prevent free-riding and to improve the efficiency of optimistic unchoking. We then propose a stochastic model to analyze the performance of our algorithm. We also verify the results by simulations. Both theoretical and simulation results show that our algorithm can effectively prevent free-riding and significantly improve the download rate of normal peers at the same time.},

abstract = {Peer-to-peer live-streaming (P2P-TV) systems' goal is disseminating real-time video content using peer-to-peer technology. Their performance is driven by the overlay topology, i.e., the virtual topology that peers use to exchange video chunks. Several proposals have been made in the past to optimize it, yet few experimental studies have corroborated results. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive experimental comparison based on PeerStreamer in order to benchmark different strategies for the construction and maintenance of the overlay topology in P2P-TV systems. We present only experimental results in which fully distributed strategies are evaluated in both controlled experiments and the Internet using thousands of peers. Results confirm that the topological properties of the overlay have a deep impact on both user quality of experience and network load. Strategies based solely on random peer selection are greatly outperformed by smart yet simple and actually implementable strategies. The most performing strategy we devise guarantees to deliver almost all chunks to all peers with a playout delay as low as 6 s even when system load approaches 1, and in almost adversarial network scenarios. PeerStreamer is open-source to make results reproducible and allow further research by the community.},

abstract = {Most peer-to-peer content distribution systems require the peers to privilege the welfare of the overall system over greedily maximizing their own utility. When downloading a file broken up into multiple pieces, peers are often asked to pass on some possible download opportunities of common pieces in order to favor rare pieces. This is to avoid the missing piece syndrome, which throttles the download rate of the peer-to-peer system to that of downloading the file straight from the server. In other situations, peers are asked to stay in the system even though they have collected all the file's pieces and have an incentive to leave right away. We propose a mechanism which allows peers to act greedily and yet stabilizes the peer-to-peer content sharing system. Our mechanism combines a fountain code at the server to generate innovative new pieces, and a prioritization for the server to deliver pieces only to new peers. While by itself, neither the fountain code nor the prioritization of new peers alone stabilizes the system, we demonstrate that their combination does, through both analytical and numerical evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {There are two types of P2P systems satisfying two different user demands: 1) file downloading and 2) video-on-demand (VoD) streaming. An example of file downloading is the original BitTorrent, and examples for VoD streaming include various commercial P2P-based VoD streaming systems such as that offered by PPLive. We have a hypothesis - by combining a type: 1) system and 2) system as a single P2P system, both the file downloading users and the streaming users of the same video will benefit in performance. The reasoning is that at any moment, only a subset of the file downloading peers can provide good service to VoD streaming peers and the VoD streaming peers are only good at providing service to a different subset of the file downloading peers. The former subset is the set of peers close to completing the downloading of the video file; whereas the latter subset is the set of peers starting to download a video. In this paper, we propose a novel design for a mesh-based video distribution system without depending on video replication on streaming peers. We produce simple back-of-the-envelop analysis to show its effectiveness. Then, we further validate our design and compare it with other designs through simulation and experiments in practical networking environment by implementing a prototype.},
